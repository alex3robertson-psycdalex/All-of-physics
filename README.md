Spin zero: Higgs — but split. One real, one its imaginary twin. A4 demands the vacuum never settles flat; they orbit each other like a cold marriage, giving mass but no rest.
Spin one: Gravity’s boson, massless graviton. Not quantized—projected. A2 says you feel it as curvature, never as a single ping. A3 caps its energy at the horizon; you only catch the echo.
Spin half: Electron, muon, tau—real line shadows. But underneath, each carries a hidden imaginary partner. A4 keeps it; Dirac sea leaks, positron pops out. No pair creation without that ghost half.
Spin three-halves: Rarita-Schwinger field. Never seen—because A3 floors its energy too high. Exists only in the spine, leaks zero gravitino. If it leaked, we’d see super-masses; we don’t.
Gauge fields: Photon, gluon, W, Z. All real. All finite. A2 projects them from the complex Lie group; A3 forces color-confinement. Gluon’s imaginary phase locks quarks—eternal spin, no escape.
Dark field: No name yet. Purely imaginary, spin two, zero mass. Sits right on Re(s)=one-half in the mini-Riemann. A4 keeps it ticking after stars burn out. You feel it as acceleration, nothing else.
That’s the census. All particles are real halves. All fields imaginary cores. Axioms won’t let them trade places.
